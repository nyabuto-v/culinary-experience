          <h3>Procedure for cooking soft chapati</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>In a bowl, measure three cups of flour.</li>
              <li>In another bowl, mix salt, sugar, 2 tbps of oil and 1 cup of water. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.</li>
              <li>Pour the liquid mixture above (step 2) in the flour bowl and mix well. Keep adding the remaining water until the dough becomes soft.</li>
              <li>Knead the dough for five minutes and add flour if needed</li>
              <li>Transfer the dough on a flat surface and continue kneading and adding flour when needed for 10 minutes. Add more flour to make it more thick but not too hard.</li>
              <li>Return the ready chapati dough in a bowl, add some oil and knead to mix it up until it soft and not sticky. Cover the dough and leave it for 40 minutes.</li>
              <li>After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 to 13 equal parts making ball like shapes. Arrange them in a flat surface dusted with flour.</li>
              <li>Right away, pick one of the balls and place it on a flat surface.</li>
              <li>With a rolling pin, roll the ball to a circular shape.</li>
              <li>Brush the circular chapati with oil on top.</li>
              <li>At the side that faces you, start folding and rolling the oiled chapati with both hands as if you are rolling a rode away from your direction.</li>
              <li>Once you have a shape that looks like a rope, create a coil like shape.</li>
              <li>Make a coiled ball and with your palm, press the ball down to make it flat. </li>
              <li>Next, with a rolling pin make a circular shape again. (As you can see the image, layers can be seen on the rolled out chapati).</li>
              <li>In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each side until its golden brown on medium heat.(Repeat step 8 to 15 until you finish the rest chapati dough balls). Put your cooked chapati in plastic wrap or container and cover. Serve after 20 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Procedure for cooking beans with cocounut milk</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>In a cooking pan fry onions</li>
              <li>Add tomatoes and fry until tender. Use a cooking pot to press the tomatoes while cooking to make them soft quickly. Add garlic, Cardamom seeds, curry powder, Royco, cinnamon and salt and stir for 1 minute.</li>
              <li>Add beans and cook for 30 seconds</li>
              <li>Add coconut milk then stir, cover and cook until all is tender, stirring occasionally. In case the milk cooks away before the beans, add extra coconut milk. The liquid should be the same level with beans when beans are ready to serve.</li>
              <li>Garnish with dry or fresh Parsley or Coriander and serve with soft chapati.</li>
