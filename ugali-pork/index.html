            <h3><b>Ugali</b></h3>
            <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>4 cups of water</li>
              <li>2 cups of maize flour/cornmeal</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Pour water to a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil</li>
              <li>Add a handful of the maize flour/cornmeal to the boiling water.</li>
              <li>Using a flat wooden spoon, stir the mixture to form a porridge-like consistency.</li>
              <li>Continue adding the maize flour a little at a time while pressing to the sides of the saucepan to remove any lumps.</li>
              <li>If there are no more lumps stop stirring and let it cook for about ten minutes.</li>
              <li>At this point the mixture has become firm. Stir with the wooden spoon again and let it cook for a further three to five minutes.</li>
              <li>Form the mixture into a round shape by bringing together the dough from the sides of the saucepan to the mixture. Transfer to a flat plate by turning the saucepan over on top of the plate.</li>
              <li>If need be, the ugali can be cut into smaller chunks.</li>
              <li>Serve with the beef stew while hot.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><b>Pork</b></h3>
            <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>1/2 kg Pork Leg Meat(choose one with some fat/skin) Cut into cubes.</li>
              <li>1 Onion(Diced small)</li>
              <li>Garlic/garlic Paste</li>
              <li>1 Tomato(cut into small cubes)</li>
              <li>Coriander(chopped)</li>
              <li>Seasoning(Salt and Pepper)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>On a hot pan and with NO OIL, select and cook the pork with the skin on first. The idea is to ensure the skin part gets more time to cook to be edible. (If you are using skinless meat, add little oil).</li>
              <li>The pork fat will help in the browning of the meat. Add the skinless meat and cover the pan to allow the meat to cook.</li>
              <li>When all the juices have evaporated and the meat starts drying, add the onion and garlic.</li>
              <li>Allow for the meat to brown as you keep on stirring to prevent from sticking.</li>
              <li>Add the tomatoes and seasoning, stir and cover to allow the tomato to cook.</li>
              <li>Taste and correct the seasoning. The meat should be cooked by now. Avoid adding water during cooking but do so only to give the meat more cooking time.</li>
              <li>Just before turning off the heat, add the optional coriander then serve hot.</li>
              <li>The cooking time should not be long owing to the fact pork is not a tough meat so avoid overcooking it.</li>
              <li>Serve with Ugali while hot.</li>
            </ul>
